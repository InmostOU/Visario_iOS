# Visario_iOS
The Visario project is an example of the implementation of a communication platform based on Amazon Chaim SDK by the engineers of the Inmost team. AWS microservices make it easy to create chats, appointments, calendars and other functions within an existing client app or site. The received communication fitures are distinguished by high quality of communication, data transmission security and minimal implementation time.
